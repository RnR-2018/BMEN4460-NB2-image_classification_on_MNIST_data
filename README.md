## Image classification on MNIST data.

This repository is a child repository of [**RnR-2018/Deep-learning-with-PyTorch-and-GCP**](https://github.com/RnR-2018/Deep-learning-with-PyTorch-and-GCP). This serves a primary purpose of facilitating the course BMEN4460 instructed by Dr. Andrew Laine and Dr. Jia Guo at Columbia University. However, it can also be used as a general beginner-level tutorial to implementing deep learning algorithms with PyTorch on Google Cloud Platform.

This notebook is largely inspired by and adapted from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/jkotra/mnist-pytorch). The network architecture used in the tutorial comes from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/floydhub/mnist).
